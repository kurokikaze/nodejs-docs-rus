+
+Consider this situation:
+
+`a.js`:
+
+    console.log('a starting');
+    exports.done = false;
+    var b = require('./b.js');
+    console.log('in a, b.done = %j', b.done);

+    var a = require('./a.js');
+    var b = require('./b.js');
+    console.log('in main, a.done=%j, b.done=%j', a.done, b.done);
+
+When `main.js` loads `a.js`, then `a.js` in turn loads `b.js`.  At that
+point, `b.js` tries to load `a.js`.  In order to prevent an infinite
+loop an **unfinished copy** of the `a.js` exports object is returned to the
+`b.js` module.  `b.js` then finishes loading, and its exports object is
+provided to the `a.js` module.
+
+By the time `main.js` has loaded both modules, they're both finished.
+The output of this program would thus be:
+
+    $ node main.js
+    main starting
+    a starting
+    b starting

+The TLS protocol lets the client renegotiate certain aspects of the TLS session.
+Unfortunately, session renegotiation requires a disproportional amount of

+attacks.
+
+To mitigate this, renegotiations are limited to three times every 10 minutes. An
+error is emitted on the [CleartextStream](#tls.CleartextStream) instance when
+the threshold is exceeded. The limits are configurable:
+
+  - `tls.CLIENT_RENEG_LIMIT`: renegotiation limit, default is 3.
+
+  - `tls.CLIENT_RENEG_WINDOW`: renegotiation window in seconds, default is
+                               10 minutes.

+## NPN and SNI
+
+<!-- type=misc -->
+
+NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation) and SNI (Server Name Indication) are TLS
+handshake extensions allowing you:
+
+  * NPN - to use one TLS server for multiple protocols (HTTP, SPDY)
+  * SNI - to use one TLS server for multiple hostnames with different SSL
+    certificates.
+
+
+## tls.createServer(options, [secureConnectionListener])
+
+Creates a new [tls.Server](#tls.Server).
+The `connectionListener` argument is automatically set as a listener for the
+[secureConnection](#event_secureConnection_) event.
+The `options` object has these possibilities:
 
   - `key`: A string or `Buffer` containing the private key of the server in
     PEM format. (Required)
 
+  - `passphrase`: A string of passphrase for the private key.
+
   - `cert`: A string or `Buffer` containing the certificate key of the server in
+    PEM format. (Required)
+
+  - `ca`: An array of strings or `Buffer`s of trusted certificates. If this is
+    omitted several well known "root" CAs will be used, like VeriSign.
+    These are used to authorize connections.
+
+  - `ciphers`: A string describing the ciphers to use or exclude. Consult
+    <http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html#CIPHER_LIST_FORMAT> for
+    details on the format.
+
+  - `requestCert`: If `true` the server will request a certificate from
+    clients that connect and attempt to verify that certificate. Default:
+    `false`.
+
+  - `rejectUnauthorized`: If `true` the server will reject any connection
+    which is not authorized with the list of supplied CAs. This option only
+    has an effect if `requestCert` is `true`. Default: `false`.
+
+  - `NPNProtocols`: An array or `Buffer` of possible NPN protocols. (Protocols
+    should be ordered by their priority).
+
+  - `SNICallback`: A function that will be called if client supports SNI TLS
+    extension. Only one argument will be passed to it: `servername`. And
+    `SNICallback` should return SecureContext instance.
+    (You can use `crypto.createCredentials(...).context` to get proper
+    SecureContext). If `SNICallback` wasn't provided - default callback with
+    high-level API will be used (see below).
+
+  - `sessionIdContext`: A string containing a opaque identifier for session
+    resumption. If `requestCert` is `true`, the default is MD5 hash value
+    generated from command-line. Otherwise, the default is not provided.
+
+Here is a simple example echo server:
+
+    var tls = require('tls');
+    var fs = require('fs');
+
+    var options = {
+      key: fs.readFileSync('server-key.pem'),
+      cert: fs.readFileSync('server-cert.pem'),
+
+      // This is necessary only if using the client certificate authentication.
+      requestCert: true,
+
+      // This is necessary only if the client uses the self-signed certificate.
+      ca: [ fs.readFileSync('client-cert.pem') ]
+    };
+
+    var server = tls.createServer(options, function(cleartextStream) {
+      console.log('server connected',
+                  cleartextStream.authorized ? 'authorized' : 'unauthorized');
+      cleartextStream.write("welcome!\n");
+      cleartextStream.setEncoding('utf8');
+      cleartextStream.pipe(cleartextStream);
+    });
+    server.listen(8000, function() {
+      console.log('server bound');
+    });
+
+
+You can test this server by connecting to it with `openssl s_client`:
+
+
+    openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:8000
+
+
+## tls.connect(port, [host], [options], [secureConnectListener])
+
+Creates a new client connection to the given `port` and `host`. (If `host`
+defaults to `localhost`.) `options` should be an object which specifies
+
+  - `key`: A string or `Buffer` containing the private key of the client in
+    PEM format.
+
+  - `passphrase`: A string of passphrase for the private key.
+
+  - `cert`: A string or `Buffer` containing the certificate key of the client in
     PEM format.
 
   - `ca`: An array of strings or `Buffer`s of trusted certificates. If this is
     omitted several well known "root" CAs will be used, like VeriSign.
     These are used to authorize connections.
 
+  - `NPNProtocols`: An array of string or `Buffer` containing supported NPN
+    protocols. `Buffer` should have following format: `0x05hello0x05world`,
+    where first byte is next protocol name's length. (Passing array should
+    usually be much simpler: `['hello', 'world']`.)
+
+  - `servername`: Servername for SNI (Server Name Indication) TLS extension.
+
+  - `socket`: Establish secure connection on a given socket rather than
+    creating a new socket. If this option is specified, `host` and `port`
+    are ignored.  This is intended FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY.  As with all
+    undocumented APIs in Node, they should not be used.
+
+The `secureConnectListener` parameter will be added as a listener for the
+['secureConnect'](#event_secureConnect_) event.
+
 `tls.connect()` returns a [CleartextStream](#tls.CleartextStream) object.
 
-After the TLS/SSL handshake the `callback` is called. The `callback` will be
-called no matter if the server's certificate was authorized or not. It is up
-to the user to test `s.authorized` to see if the server certificate was signed
-by one of the specified CAs. If `s.authorized === false` then the error can be
-found in `s.authorizationError`.
+Here is an example of a client of echo server as described previously:
 
+    var tls = require('tls');
+    var fs = require('fs');
 
-### STARTTLS
+    var options = {

+    
+      // This is necessary only if the server uses the self-signed certificate
+      ca: [ fs.readFileSync('server-cert.pem') ]
+    };
 
-In the v0.4 branch no function exists for starting a TLS session on an
-already existing TCP connection.  This is possible it just requires a bit of
-work. The technique is to use `tls.createSecurePair()` which returns two
-streams: an encrypted stream and a cleartext stream. The encrypted stream is

-thereafter.
+    var cleartextStream = tls.connect(8000, options, function() {

+## Class: tls.Server
 
 This class is a subclass of `net.Server` and has the same methods on it.
 Instead of accepting just raw TCP connections, this accepts encrypted
 connections using TLS or SSL.
 
-Here is a simple example echo server:
-
-    var tls = require('tls');
-    var fs = require('fs');
-
-    var options = {
-      key: fs.readFileSync('server-key.pem'),
-      cert: fs.readFileSync('server-cert.pem')

-#### tls.createServer(options, secureConnectionListener)
-
-This is a constructor for the `tls.Server` class. The options object
-has these possibilities:
-
-  - `key`: A string or `Buffer` containing the private key of the server in
-    PEM format. (Required)
-
-  - `cert`: A string or `Buffer` containing the certificate key of the server in
-    PEM format. (Required)
-
-  - `ca`: An array of strings or `Buffer`s of trusted certificates. If this is
-    omitted several well known "root" CAs will be used, like VeriSign.
-    These are used to authorize connections.
-
-  - `requestCert`: If `true` the server will request a certificate from
-    clients that connect and attempt to verify that certificate. Default:
-    `false`.
-
-  - `rejectUnauthorized`: If `true` the server will reject any connection
-    which is not authorized with the list of supplied CAs. This option only
-    has an effect if `requestCert` is `true`. Default: `false`.
